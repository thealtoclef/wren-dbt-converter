"""Result cache + singleflight (one mechanism, one key namespace).

Combines:
- TTL-based result cache keyed by rendered SQL + bound params
- ``cache.lock`` for singleflight: concurrent misses on the same key
  serialize through one warehouse roundtrip

TTL semantics:
- ``ttl > 0``  : cache for that many seconds
- ``ttl == 0`` : "realtime + minimal coalescing window". We still acquire
  the lock (so a burst still coalesces), but persist for ~1s only —
  enough that the 99 callers waiting on the lock all get the same result.

Note on the lock key: we use ``f"{key}:lock"``, not ``f"lock:{key}"``,
so that the lock inherits the same key prefix as its data entry. Any
prefix-routed multi-backend setup that puts ``sql:`` keys on Redis
will then put the corresponding locks on Redis too — without that,
the singleflight lock lives on a different backend than the data
and cluster-wide coalescing silently breaks.
